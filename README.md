# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Resume Matcher

This project is an AI-based Resume Matcher that analyzes a candidateâ€™s resume, extracts skills using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/GPT), and compares them to a provided Job Description (JD) to compute a skill match score.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **AI Engine**: LangChain + LLM (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- **Parsing**: PDF/Text resume loader
- **Database**: MongoDB (via `matches_collection`)
- **Embedding Model**: HuggingFace (MiniLM-L6-v2 for FAISS-based RAG â€“ optional)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompt with context injection

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. User uploads a resume
2. User provides a JD as a structured JSON like:

```json
{
  "job_title": "AI/ML Engineer",
  "primarySkills": ["Python", "Machine Learning"],
  "secondarySkills": ["Scikit-learn", "Keras"],
  "projectSkills": ["CNN", "LSTM", "Data Preprocessing"]
}


ðŸ’» Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/Nevivaghani/Resume-Matcher.git
cd resume-matcher

2. Install backend dependencies

poetry install

3. Start FastAPI backend

poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload     

4. Run Streamlit frontend

poetry run streamlit run app/frontend/main.py

ðŸ§ª Testing

{
  "job_title": "Machine Learning Engineer",
  "primarySkills": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning"],
  "secondarySkills": ["Scikit-learn", "Keras", "Pandas"],
  "projectSkills": ["CNN", "Logistic Regression", "Data Preprocessing"]
}


ðŸ§  Prompt Example (used in matcher.py)
The prompt instructs the LLM to:

Ignore irrelevant sections like "Languages"

Extract real work-based skills

Compare with job description by category

Calculate matching percentages

Output results in clean JSON
