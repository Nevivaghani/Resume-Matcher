# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Resume Matcher

This project is an AI-based Resume Matcher that analyzes a candidateâ€™s resume, extracts skills using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI/GPT), and compares them to a provided Job Description (JD) to compute a skill match score.



## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **AI Engine**: LangChain + LLM (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- **Parsing**: PDF/Text resume loader
- **Database**: MongoDB (via `matches_collection`)
- **Embedding Model**: HuggingFace (MiniLM-L6-v2 for FAISS-based RAG â€“ optional)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompt with context injection
